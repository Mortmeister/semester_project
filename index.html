            <h1>About the museum</h1>
            <p>
              Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
              to making science accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
              early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
              everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
              life itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
              experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite
              a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
              brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
              different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
              explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
              with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
              dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
              everyone’s gone home).
